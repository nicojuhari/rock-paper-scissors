        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 pt-10">How to Win at Rock-Paper-Scissors?</h2>
        <p>While RPS seems like a game of pure luck, there are strategies you can use to increase your chances of winning:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5">
            <li><strong>Observe Your Opponent: </strong> Pay attention to patterns in your opponent's choices. For example, if they keep playing "Rock," you can counter with "Paper."</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Psychology: </strong>
                <ul class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6 space-y-1">
                    <li>First Move Psychology: Many players instinctively choose "Rock" as their first move. Counter with "Paper" to gain an edge.</li>
                    <li>Mimic and Adapt: Some opponents subconsciously mimic their previous moves. Adjust your strategy accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Avoid Predictability: </strong> 
                <ul class="list-decimal list-inside pl-6 space-y-1">
                    <li>Switch up your choices to keep your opponent guessing.</li>
                    <li>Avoid forming a pattern they can exploit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Play the Long Game: </strong> In a series of matches, observe how your opponent reacts after losing. Players often repeat a losing move or overthink and switch too drastically.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Statistics: </strong> Studies show certain moves (like "Rock") are more common in casual games. Use this knowledge to anticipate and counter popular choices.</li>
        </ul>
