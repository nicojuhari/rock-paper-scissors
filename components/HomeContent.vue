    <div class="space-y-6">
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Here's how to start:</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">🎮 Step 1: Create a Game</h3>
        <p>Click on "Create a Game" to generate a private game room where you can invite a friend to play.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">🔗 Step 2: Share the Link</h3>
        <p>Send the unique link to your friend or family member so they can join your game room.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">🤝 Step 3: Start Playing</h3>
        <p>Each player picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The winner is decided based on these rules:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
          <li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
          <li>Paper beats Rock</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">If both players choose the same move, it's a tie — play again!</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">👀 Watch for Patterns</h3>
        <p>Pay attention to what your opponent plays. If they favor a move like "Rock," use "Paper" to counter.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">🧠 Use Psychology</h3>
        <p>Many players start with "Rock" — open with "Paper" to gain the upper hand.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">🔁 Stay Unpredictable</h3>
        <p>Switch up your choices often. Avoid creating patterns that your opponent can guess.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold">📊 Play the Long Game</h3>
        <p>Observe how your opponent reacts after losing. Most people either repeat or completely change their move — use this to your advantage.</p>
